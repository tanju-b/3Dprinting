Proteus-RepRap
=============

my fork off of Redbeard's Kraken Build (misumi box)

this is my first repo and Redbeard did not Git his build, just shared a bunch of knowledge and some files via dropbox

This repo consists of my varation for my build, which is a bit of RepStrap as I did not have super convient access to a printer and so took some liberties to speed up the build by leaning out the design.
If I had simply cloned the Kraken, it would have taken me a couple of months to get all the parts printed out.

The Kraken was dubbed down at FreesideATL, originally Redbeard had simply called it a Misumibox since he built it out of Misumi supplied 20-series extruded aluminum
